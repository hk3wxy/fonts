# fonts
A personal collection of fonts for use in my projects. This repository is not intended to be a comprehensive collection of all available fonts, but rather a curated selection of fonts that I find useful or interesting.

Mostly used for Linux and Photoshop.

## Installation on Arch Linux

You can install these fonts from the AUR:

```bash
yay -S your-fonts
